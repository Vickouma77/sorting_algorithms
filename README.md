# Sorting algorithms & Big O

A sorting algorithm is a method for arranging a set of data in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. Examples of sorting algorithms include:
```burble sort```  ```insertion sort``` ```selection sort``` ```merge sort``` and ```quick sort```

Big-O notation is a way to describe the performance of an algorithm, specifically the amount of time it takes for the algorithm to complete. It describes the upper bound on the number of operations the algorithm performs in relation to the size of the input data set. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) will take roughly the same amount of time to complete regardless of the size of the input data set, while an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) will take much longer to complete as the size of the input data set increases.
